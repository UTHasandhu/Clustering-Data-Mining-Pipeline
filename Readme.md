\# An exercise for learning unsupervised learning techniques


This project explores unsupervised learning techniques to segment datasets using clustering algorithms.  

Developed as part of a Machine Learning course at UT Austin.  



\## Features

\- Implemented \*\*K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering\*\* from scratch and with scikit-learn.

\- Built a \*\*data preprocessing pipeline\*\* including feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and distance metrics.

\- Applied \*\*data manipulation and cleaning\*\* with Pandas and NumPy.

\- Evaluated cluster quality using \*\*silhouette score, cohesion, and separation\*\*.

\- Created \*\*data visualizations\*\* (scatter plots, dendrograms) to illustrate segmentation results.



\## Technologies

\- Python  

\- NumPy  

\- Pandas  

\- scikit-learn  

\- Matplotlib  

\- SciPy  



\## Example Visualizations

Clustering results are displayed with scatter plots and hierarchical dendrograms, enabling clear interpretation of group patterns in the dataset.



You can see some of these in the pngs seen in the repo or in the notebook.
